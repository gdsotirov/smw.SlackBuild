smw: Super Mario War - A Super Mario Multiplayer Game
smw:
smw: Super Mario War is a multiplayer game. The goal is to stomp as many
smw: other Marios as possible to win the game. It's a tribute to Nintendo
smw: and the game Mario War by Samuele Poletto.
smw: The game uses artwork and sounds from Nintendo games. We hope that
smw: this noncommercial fangame qualifies as fair use work. We just wanted
smw: to create this game to show how much we adore Nintendo's characters
smw: and games.
